"""MCP server entry point (Blueprint 1.1: renamed from example_server).

Keep this file THIN. It only:
  1. creates the FastMCP instance,
  2. registers tools / prompts / resources / routes from the submodules, and
  3. decides which transport to run (stdio locally vs. HTTP when deployed).

All real logic lives in the submodules:
  - tools/      one file per tool (each exposes `register(mcp)`)
  - prompts/    reusable conversation starters
  - resources/  static/semi-static data the client can read directly
  - routes.py   HTTP-only infrastructure (health check, etc.)
  - config.py   settings loaded from env vars / .env
  - models.py   Pydantic models & enums for tool parameters
  - utils.py    shared helpers (HTTP client, formatting, pagination)
